This repository contains the code used in "Compressed Sensing: Mathematical Foundations, Implementation, and Advanced Optimization Techniques" by Shane Stevenson and Maryam Sabagh. 
 
 The code in "compressed_sensing_naive.ipynb" is our original work, while the code in "compressed_sensing_OWL-QN.ipynb" isnot our original work, and the original creater is credited both in the code here,and in the project report. ("project.pdf")
